# SJ-Grocer

Website created for final CMPE131 course at San Jose State. 

Over the course of three months, my team members Mercy Derese, Mohammad Daza, and I put together this web application. Every week we had the project manager (Frank Butt)
review our sprint goals and progress during Scrum meetings. Along the way, we created design documents, prototyped software, and learned PHP, CSS, and Javascript. 

The end product is a website that manages user logins, registration, and common grocery store information. Users can be "promoted" to admin status and have access
to an admin panel. From here, they're able to manage user orders, see stats on store income, respond to messages, add product to the store, and more! 

The intended use is to assist San Jose grocery stores in dealing with the complications of online orders and delivery. This one app makes it possible to manage all 
of that and more, with a much more understandible interface that it's competition. 






Course requirement:
Description: The group project is designed for the students to learn the end-to-end software 
development process.  This assignment requires you to build a web-based application server with 
emphasis in reusable components and infrastructures.  

Problem statement – New local food retailer chain, “OFS”, in the San Jose Downtown area wants to 
implement delivery services as part of their business plan.  You are responsible to develop the website 
where customer can purchase organic food online (e.g. fruits, vegetables, and other grocery items) into a 
virtual shopping cart.  Pay for it online and have it delivered to their home.  Inventory, customer, 
transactions are processed and stored in RDBMS.
Special note: If the weight of the total order is less than 20 pounds, delivery is free.  Otherwise you will 
add a delivery charge of $5 to the order.  You need to track the weight of each food item in the database 
and shopping cart.

Software:
OS – MS Windows, Mac OS, or Linux for the Server pieces
Web Server – Apache
Database – Any relational DBMS for storing and retrieving data, MySQL chosen.
Client – Should work on any web browser, mainly Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Safari (at least 2) - Tested on Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari, and mobile.
Data – Create sample (need to be realistic) data for demo and testing purpose
Source Code Repository – GitHub

Implementation and Process Documents
1. Completed project with all the data and code packaged together.  If you run on a hosted website, 
document it in the User’s guide.  If you have starting data (e.g. test data like userid, accounts, 
store location, , ...), make sure you preload them for testing by TA.  I suggest you encapsulated 
everything into a Docker Container Image.

2. Required Documents: 
- Backlog history from the beginning (which includes completed tasks by each team member); 
- User’s Guide (describe usage scenarios and main functions, minimum of 5 pages), should 
contain screen shots in different sections when you are describing those sections.
- Updated documents from Part I and II if designs and/or assumptions changed
- A how-to video (between 3 to 4 min) how to use your website, if the video file size is too 
large to upload, make it available to be accessed by the TA from a shared drive (e.g. Google 
Drive).
